# Miscellaneous Java Utilities

These are miscellaneous classes or code snippets that were gathered over the years.

We will **not**:
- Promise any kind of cohesion among these utilities.
- Guarantee backward (or any) compatibility between versions; the intention is to stay at version _0.x_ for ever.

However:
- There is no intention to deliberately break things.
- If certain utilities turn out to be more useful than others,
  we may split them into a separate library which we _can_ guarantee backward compatibility for.  
  Please file an issue if there is something you would like to see more stabilized.
- You may use these utilities as you wish in open source or commercial products either through a dependency or copy-pasting the code.  
  A link to this repository would be nice (and might help remember where you found it).
- Hopefully you can find something useful in this repository.
- Contributions are accepted and welcomed. Feel free to file a pull-request.
